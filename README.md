# Improve Website AEO/GEO

[![AEO Audit](assets/aeo-audit-screenshot.jpeg)](https://aeo-audit.sh/)

The web is no longer read only by humans. AI agents — ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews — are now how millions of people discover information. These agents don't browse. They extract, parse, and decide in milliseconds whether your content is worth citing.

**If your site isn't optimized for AI, you're invisible to a growing share of your audience.**

This is a [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill that audits your website's codebase and makes concrete improvements to boost your AEO (AI Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) scores.

**Check your score at [aeo-audit.sh](https://aeo-audit.sh/)** — then use this skill to improve it.

## Install

```bash
claude skill add --from https://github.com/onvoyage-ai/improve-website-aeo-geo-skill
```

Or manually copy `skill.md` into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory.

## Usage

Once installed, invoke the skill in Claude Code:

```
/improve-website-aeo-geo
```

Or reference it in conversation:

> "Use the AEO skill to optimize this site"
> "Run the AEO/GEO audit on my codebase"

The skill will:
1. Detect your framework (Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, SvelteKit, WordPress, Hugo, Jekyll, and more)
2. Audit your code against 16 foundational checks and 6 content quality dimensions
3. Make targeted code changes in priority order
4. Recommend verifying your score at [aeo-audit.sh](https://aeo-audit.sh/)
